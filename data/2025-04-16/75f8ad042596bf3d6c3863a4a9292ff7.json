That's a Python library for building UIs, right?\"\nWe hear this a lot, and while Gradio does let you create interactive UIs with minimal Python code, calling Gradio a \"UI library\" misses the bigger picture! Gradio is\nmore\nthan a UI library—it's a framework for\ninteracting with machine learning models\nthrough both UIs and APIs, providing strong guarantees around performance, security, and responsiveness.\nIn this article, we'll introduce features that are unique to Gradio and explain how they are essential for building powerful AI applications. We'll share links to Gradio's official documentation and release notes, so you can explore further if you're curious.\n1.  Universal API Access\nAll Gradio apps are also APIs! When you build a Gradio app, you can also use Gradio's robust client libraries for programmatic access to these Gradio applications. We offer:\nOfficial SDKs in Python (gradio_client) and JavaScript (@gradio/client), plus support for cURL API access\nAutomatic generation of REST API endpoints for each event defined in your Gradio app\nAutomatically-generated API documentation, accessible through the \"View API\" link\nClient libraries with advanced features like file handling, Hugging Face Space duplication, and more\nFurther Reading:\nExplore Client Libraries\n,\nQuerying Gradio Apps with Curl\nWhat Sets Gradio Apart\n:\nMost other Python frameworks lack official API access mechanisms\nWhile traditional web frameworks require separate implementations for UI and API endpoints, Gradio automatically generates both from a single implementation, including documentation.\n2. Interactive API Recorder for Development\nGradio's \"API Recorder\" was introduced in version 4.26. This powerful development tool enables developers to capture their UI interactions in real time and automatically generate corresponding API calls in Python or JavaScript.\n\"API Recorder\" can be found on the \"View API\" page discussed above.\nIt helps in documenting API usage of Gradio applications through your own real examples\nFurther Reading:\nExplore API Recorder\nWhat Sets Gradio Apart:\nYou cannot easily script UI interactions in this manner in most other Python and Web frameworks. This is a capability unique to Gradio in the ML tooling landscape.\nThe combination of API Recorder with Gradio Client libraries creates a smooth transition from UI exploration to development using API endpoints.\n3. Fast ML Apps with Server-Side Rendering\nGradio 5.0 introduced server-side rendering (SSR), changing how ML applications load and perform. While traditional UI frameworks rely on client-side rendering, Gradio's SSR:\nEliminates the loading spinner and significantly reduces initial page load times\nPre-renders the UI on the server, enabling immediate user interaction\nImproves SEO for published applications\nGets automatically enabled for Hugging Face Spaces deployments while remaining configurable for local development\nFurther Reading:\nRead more about Gradio 5's SSR\nWhat Sets Gradio Apart:\nTraditional Python UI frameworks are limited to client-side rendering while implementing SSR in JS web frameworks requires extensive full-stack development expertise\nGradio delivers web framework-level performance while maintaining a pure Python development experience (Note: except for having to installing Node!)\n4. Automatic Queue Management for ML Tasks\nGradio provides a sophisticated queuing system tailored for ML applications that handles both GPU-intensive computations and high-volume user access.\nGradio's queue automatically handles different kinds of tasks defined in your application, whether they are long predictions that run on a GPU, audio/video streaming, or non-ML tasks.\nYour applications can scale to thousands of concurrent users without resource contention and system overwhelming\nReal-time queue status updates via Server-Side Events, showing users their current position in the queue.\nYou can configure concurrency limits for parallel processing of requests\nYou can even have different events pool resources through shared queues using\nconcurrency_id\nFurther Reading:\nLearn about Queuing\n,\nExplore Concurrency Controls\nWhat Sets Gradio Apart:\nMost other Python frameworks don't offer resource management while running concurrent sessions. If you are using popular web frameworks, you might have to implement queuing system manually yourself.\nGradio's built-in queue management system eliminates the need for external schedulers and allows you to build GPU-intensive or viral ML applications.\n5. High-Performance Streaming for Real-Time ML Outputs\nGradio's streaming capabilities enable real-time, low-latency updates crucial for modern ML applications. The framework provides:\nA simple developer experience: Gradio offers streaming through simple Python generators using\nyield\nstatements.\nThis supports token-by-token text generation streaming, step-by-step image generation updates, or even smooth audio/video streaming via HTTP Live Streaming (HLS) protocol\nWebRTC/WebSocket API for real-time applications via\nFastRTC\nFurther Reading:\nImplementation guide\n,\nLearn more about Gradio 5's streaming improvements\nWhat Sets Gradio Apart:\nOther Python frameworks require manual thread management and polling for streaming updates. Web frameworks similarly need custom WebSocket or WebRTC implementation for real-time streaming.\nYou can create real-time audio/video streaming applications entirely in Python with\nFastRTC\nand Gradio.\n6. Integrated Multi-Page Application Support\nGradio has evolved beyond single-page applications with its native multi-page support, enabling developers to build comprehensive AI/ML applications.\nYou can have multiple pages within a single application context\nGradio provide automatic URL routing and navigation bar generation\nBackend resources, such as the queue, are shared across pages\nDevelopers can split code across multiple files while maintaining a single application context. This is good for file maintainability and testing.\nFurther Reading:\nExplore Multi-Page Apps\n,\nLearn about page organization\nWhat Sets Gradio Apart:\nOther Python frameworks require separate scripts for each page, limiting state sharing among the pages. Popular Web frameworks also require explicit routing setup.\nGradio offers automatic routing and navigation bar using simple Python declarations! This feature transforms Gradio from a demo platform into a robust web framework for building full-featured ML applications.\n7. New Client-Side Function Execution With Groovy\nGradio 5 introduces an automatic Python-to-JavaScript transpilation library called Groovy. This now enables instant UI responsiveness without server roundtrips.\nPython functions can do simple UI updates directly within the browser with\njs=True\nflag\nUsed mainly for immediate updates of various Component properties\nThis eliminates latency for simple UI interactions\nReduces server load for basic interface updates. Especially useful for viral hosted apps or when using apps on high latency connections.\nEnables developers to write highly responsive applications without JavaScript expertise\nFurther Reading:\nRead about Client-Side Functions\nWhat Sets Gradio Apart:\nMost other Python frameworks require server roundtrips for all UI updates. Popular Web frameworks implement separate JavaScript codebase for client-side logic.\nGradio's automatic transpilation from Python to JavaScript provides a single-language development experience while delivering web-native performance—a combination not found in other frameworks.\n8. A Comprehensive Theming System and Modern UI Components\nGradio offers a sophisticated theming system that can transform your ML applications into polished, professional-looking interfaces.\nGradio has ready-to-use theme presets like Monochrome, Soft, Ocean, Glass etc. These themes have built-in dark mode support too.\nAll Gradio themes are automatically mobile responsive and we've made sure that your Gradio apps are automatically accessible for people using screen readers.\nGradio Components come with ML-specific UI choices, for example, we provide Undo/Retry/Like buttons for chat interfaces, ImageEditor and AnnotatedImage components for segmentation/masking use-cases, ImageSlider for image-to-image transformations, and so on\nGradio has recently introduced enhanced UI features for Reasoning LLMs, Agents, Multistep Agents, Nested Thoughts, and Nested Agents within our chat interfaces, elevating AI Agents to a first-class status in the chat UI.\nFurther Reading:\nExplore Gradio Themes\n,\nSee the UI Refresh\n,\nBuild UIs for Agents\nWhat Sets Gradio Apart:\nOther Python frameworks offer very limited color customization without comprehensive theming. You will have to implement theme management and CSS manually in all popular Web frameworks.\nWith Gradio ML practitioners can create professional-looking applications without web design expertise while maintaining the flexibility to implement custom branding when needed.\n9. Gradio's Dynamic Interfaces\nWith the introduction of the\n@gr.render()\ndecorator, the components and event listeners you define in your Gradio application are no longer fixed—you can add new components and listeners dynamically based on user interaction and state.\nYou can now render UI modifications on-the-fly based on model outputs or your workflow.\nPlease note that Gradio also provides a\n.render()\nmethod, which is distinct from the decorator. It allows rendering any Gradio Block within another Block.\nFurther Reading:\nExplore the Render Decorator\n,\nSee Example of Dynamic Apps\nWhat Sets Gradio Apart:\nOther Python frameworks have very limited dynamic UI capabilities. Web frameworks require JavaScript for any sort of interface updates.\nGradio allows for dynamic UI manipulation. Developers can create sophisticated and responsive interfaces using simple Python.\n10. Visual Interface Development with Gradio Sketch\nGradio Sketch introduces a visual development environment that brings to you a no-code ML application design interface. It is basically a WYSIWYG editor that helps you build your interface layout with Gradio components, define events, and attach functions to these events.\nYou can select and add components to your interface while getting a real-time preview of interface changes.\nYou can even visually add event listeners to your components. The entire app code gets generated automatically from your visual interface designs.\nGradio Sketch includes a code generator feature that allows you to create code for your inference functions.\nFurthermore, users can iterate over multiple prompts to get exactly the code they want.\nFurther Reading:\nExplore Gradio Sketch\nWhat Sets Gradio Apart:\nYou are required to write code to build your layout for all other Python frameworks.\nGradio sketch reduces the learning curve for non-coders. It significantly accelerates the application development process for everyone and thus helps democratize AI.\n11. Progressive Web App (PWA) Support\nGradio provides Progressive Web App capabilities. PWAs are web applications that are regular web pages or websites but can appear to the user as installable platform-specific applications.\nYou can create ML applications for Mobile and Desktop without providing extra configurations.\nFurther Reading:\nLearn about PWA Support\nWhat Sets Gradio Apart:\nMost Other Python frameworks lack native PWA support. You will have to configure PWA in most of the popular web frameworks manually\nThis Gradio capability makes ML applications more accessible with broader user access. You can create a mobile app instantly with an icon of your choice without additional development effort.\n12. In-Browser Execution with Gradio Lite\nGradio Lite enables browser-side execution via Pyodide (WebAssembly). You can build ML demos using client-side model inference services like Transformers.js and ONNX.\nEnhanced privacy (all data stays in the user's browser)\nZero server costs for deployment!\nOffline-capable model inference\nFurther Reading:\nExplore Gradio Lite\n,\nLearn about Transformers.js integration\nWhat Sets Gradio Apart:\nMost other Python frameworks require continuous server operation. At the same time, popular Web frameworks need separate JavaScript implementations for the backend\nThere are static website platforms that don't need a server backend, but they offer very limited or basic interactivity\nGradio enables serverless deployment of Python ML applications. With Gradio Lite, even static file hosting services (like GitHub Pages) can host complete ML applications. Gradio Lite has uniquely positioned Gradio for on-device or on-the-edge ML application delivery\n13. Accelerated Development with AI-Assisted Tooling\nGradio has introduced innovative features that dramatically speed up the ML application development cycle.\nGradio provides a hot reload capability for instant code updates in your Gradio UI during development.\nWe also offer\nAI Playground\nfor natural language-driven app generation.\nYou can rapidly prototype an app in a single line using integrations with HuggingFace and\nInference providers\n. This is also achievable with any API endpoint that is compatible with OpenAI. You can accomplish all this by simply using gr.load()\nFurther Reading:\nRead about recent innovations with Gradio 5\n,\nPrototyping with Huggingface\nWhat Sets Gradio Apart:\nMost other Python frameworks would require a manual refresh for code updates while developing the app. The same goes for most Web frameworks—you need complex build pipelines and development servers.\nWith AI Playground Gradio offers instant UI feedback and AI-assisted development. This focus on rapid development and AI-assisted tooling enables researchers and developers to create and modify ML applications quickly.\n14. Hassle-Free App Sharing\nOnce your Gradio app is ready, you can share it without worrying about deployment or hosting complexity.\nYou can generate an instant public URL by simply setting one parameter:\ndemo.launch(share=True)\n. The application is accessible on a unique domain in the format\nxxxxx.gradio.live\nwhile keeping your code and model running in your local environment\nThese share links have a 168-hour (1-week) timeout on Gradio's official share server\nYou can generate an instant public URL by simply setting one parameter:\ndemo.launch(share=True)\n. The application is accessible on\n*.gradio.live\ndomain for 1 week.\nThe share link creates a secure TLS tunnel to your locally-running app through Gradio's share server using Fast Reverse Proxy (FRP)\nFor enterprise deployments or situations requiring custom domains or additional security measures, you can host your own FRP server to avoid the 1-week timeout\nFurther Reading:\nLearn about Quick Sharing\n,\nShare Links and Share Servers\nWhat Sets Gradio Apart:\nOther Python frameworks require cloud deployment and lots of configuration for sharing your apps with public. For a Web framework, you'd need manual server setup and hosting.\nGradio offers instant sharing from your local development environment without creating any deployment pipeline, configuring a server for hosting, or any port forwarding. This gives immediate collaboration or demonstration capability to the community.\nWith over 5,000 Gradio apps being shared through share links at any given time, this approach is ideal for quick prototyping and gathering immediate feedback on your machine learning app\n15. Enterprise-Grade Security and Production Readiness\nGradio has evolved from a prototyping tool to a production-ready framework with comprehensive security measures. Our recent enhancements include:\nThird-party security audits from Trail of Bits and vulnerability assessments of Gradio build applications.\nBased on the feedback received from our security auditors, we have hardened file handling and upload controls. We now have configurable security settings via intuitive environment variables. For example, you can control file path access via GRADIO_ALLOWED_PATHS, and Server-side rendering through GRADIO_SSR_MODE\nFurther Reading:\nRead about Security Improvements\n,\nExplore Environment Variables\nWhat Sets Gradio Apart:\nMost Other Python frameworks often focus on development scenarios over production security. Your typical Web frameworks provide general security without ML-specific considerations.\nWith Gradio you get specialized security for ML deployment scenarios, protected file upload handling for ML model inputs, and sanitized model i/o processing.\nThese production-level improvements make Gradio suitable for enterprise ML deployments while maintaining its simplicity for rapid development. The Gradio framework now provides robust security defaults while offering granular control for specific deployment requirements.\n16. Enhanced Dataframe Component\nGradio's updated dataframe component addresses common data visualization needs in ML applications with practical improvements:\nMulti-cell selection\nRow numbers and column pinning for navigating large datasets\nSearch and filter functions for data exploration\nStatic (non-editable) columns\nImproved accessibility with better keyboard navigation\nFurther Reading:\nIntroducing Gradio's new Dataframe!\nWhat Sets Gradio Apart:\nOther frameworks typically require JavaScript libraries for similar functionality\nGradio implements these features while maintaining a simple Python API\nThese improvements support practical ML workflows like data exploration and interactive dashboards\n17. Deep Links for Sharing App States\nGradio's\nDeep Links\nfeature allows users to capture and share the exact state of an application:\nShare your unique model outputs with others\nCreate snapshots of your app at specific points in time\nImplement with a single\ngr.DeepLinkButton\ncomponent\nWorks with any public Gradio app (hosted or using\nshare=True\n)\nFurther Reading:\nUsing Deep Links\nWhat Sets Gradio Apart:\nMost frameworks require custom state management code to achieve similar functionality\nDeep links work across all Gradio components automatically\nEnables sharing of generated output without additional implementation effort!\nConclusion\nGradio has evolved from a demo tool into an AI-focused framework that lets developers build complete web applications in Python without requiring web development expertise.\nThe innovations in Gradio 4 and 5, such as Python-to-JavaScript transpilation, built-in queuing for resource-intensive models, real-time audio-video streaming with FastRTC, and server-side rendering, provide capabilities that would otherwise require extensive implementation work in other frameworks.\nBy handling infrastructure concerns like API endpoint generation, security vulnerabilities, and queue management, Gradio enables ML practitioners to concentrate on model development while still delivering polished user interfaces. The Gradio framework supports both rapid prototyping and production deployment scenarios through the same Python code base.\nWe invite you to\ntry Gradio\nfor your next ML project and experience firsthand why it's much more than just another UI library.
